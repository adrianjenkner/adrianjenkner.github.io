In this post, we'll explore a simple trick in TwinCAT 3 HMI to help you with visualization and testing.

If you want to display the HMI Live-View at a specific IP address, follow these steps:

1. Go to `Options` -> `TwinCAT HMI` -> `HMI Environment` -> `Binding Device`.
2. Set your desired IP address.

I use this option to display the HMI on an additional monitor outside of the virtual machine. This can be particularly useful for testing the visualization on devices such as tablets or smartphones.
